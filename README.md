C# Learning Game – Castle Adventure

This is an educational **2D game** developed in **Godot Engine** using **C#**, created as part of my learning project.  
The goal of the game is to help players learn and practice C# concepts in an interactive and engaging way.

## Game concept

The player controls a **knight** who is trapped in a castle and must complete all levels to escape.  
When starting the game, the knight enters the **main menu**, where the player can:

- Enter their name  
- Choose one of two levels (two floors of the castle):  
  - **Level 1:** For players with basic C# knowledge  
  - **Level 2:** More advanced C# concepts  

The castle has **two floors**, each representing a level. Each floor contains **5 rooms**, and each room includes **theoretical C# material** and **three exercises**:  

1. Fill in the missing code in a snippet  
2. Select the correct answer from multiple-choice options  
3. Answer a question manually  

After completing all tasks in a room, the door to the next room opens. Completing the first floor unlocks access to the second floor. After finishing all tasks on the second floor, the player returns to the menu and can select a level again.  
Each floor of the castle has a unique design and interior items. The game also includes **background music and sound effects** to enhance the learning experience and immersion.

## My role and implementation

- Developed the project using Godot Engine with C# scripting, including game logic, UI, and scene management  
- Implemented classes and objects to represent rooms, floors, and exercises  
- Created methods and functions to handle game progression, exercise validation, and player input  
- Used conditional statements and loops for game mechanics and exercise logic  
- Designed interactive menus and input forms for player name and level selection  
- Structured the project to be modular and maintainable, allowing easy addition of new rooms or exercises  

This project demonstrates my ability to apply C# programming skills in a practical, interactive application, combining logic, object-oriented programming, and user interface design.
